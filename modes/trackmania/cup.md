# Cup

## Introduction
Cup is a free-for-fall gamemode in Trackmania.

## Rules
Cup is a variation of the Rounds mode in Trackmania United. You must earn points at the end of each round by trying to finish as close to pole position as possible. Placing first each round gives you the most points while finishing last gives you nothing. However, there's a catch to it. 

Once you reach the amount of points needed, you will become a Finalist. After that, you just need to finish first to win the gamemode. Runner-ups may be available.

## Tips
Try honking your horn to throw other drivers off guard.

## Map validation
Cup mode tracks should usually be technical point-to-point tracks, but in some cases, can be multi-lap.
