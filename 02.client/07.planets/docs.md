## Gain Planets
There are many ways to gain Planets in ManiaPlanet:

* 20 Planets are earned when you connect to a title for the first time today (per environment owned, i.e: Trackmania² Canyon, Trackmania² Valley, Trackmania² Lagoon, Trackmania² Stadium, Shootmania Storm).
* 10 to 30 Planets for each medal that you earn in the solo campaign (Trackmania² Canyon, Trackmania² Valley, Trackmania² Lagoon, Trackmania² Stadium).
* 100 Planets when you earn 1000 Ladder Points.
* Bonus month (20 Planets by title/day but it's not implemented yet).
* Sell custom content to players via Manialink webpages.

## Spend Planets
You can spend these Planets for various items that ManiaPlanet offers:

* Several services available on the Maniaplanet website require Planets to do actions (like uploading a map, setting a ladder server, testing a server, etc.).
* Buying custom content from others in their Manialink webpages.
* The month Planet balance (?)
